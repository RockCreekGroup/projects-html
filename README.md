# projects-html
RockCreek Projects: HTML is the repo to use for sample HTML projects, suitable for learning and exercising HTML

Unlike a lot of READMEs, this one should be read front to back. It is almost certain that you will make unnecessary mistakes if you don't.

## Getting Started
All you need to get moving with this project is the following:
1. This repository. You should [clone it now](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).
2. Knowledge of how to branch this repo. You can [learn more about that on the Internet](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).
3. Ideally, a code editor. We like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You should use that unless you have a good reason not to.
4. A web browser. This is HTML, after all. Again, we're somewhat opinionated; [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) gives you the [best developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) and [integrates well with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/02/23/introducing-chrome-debugger-for-vs-code).

## How to Work with this Repository
It's really important that you are able to follow directions. At some point you'll have to think creatively, but sometimes, it's good to just be precise and exact in following a set of steps. This is one of those times.

Here's how you should work with this projects, and this repo:
1. [Clone the repo](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).
2. [Create your own local branch of the repo](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).
3. Work in your local branch ([because of things like this](https://thenewstack.io/dont-mess-with-the-master-working-with-branches-in-git-and-github/)).
4. [Commit your changes](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-commit) to your local branch.
5. [Push your local branch to GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/push-a-new-local-branch-to-a-remote-git-repository-and-track-it-too/13222) so we can all see it.

That's it! What you should not, ever, ever do, though is merge your changes into master. There will be no article link here because we don't want you to do this. (Later in your work, you'll make a ton of merges to master. Just not yet.) 

Permissions should be set in such a way that you can't do this, but we'll also see that you tried. We're not going to come cart you away or anything, but we do reserve the right to frown at you. It's OK though... you won't be the first, nor the last, to make this mistake.

Remember: it's all a learning experience. And for this experience, we want to preserve this initial state of the repository for everyone else to use in the same manner.

## Working on a Project
When you're ready, you should go to the [projects/](https://github.com/RockCreekGroup/projects-html/tree/master/projects) directory. Inside, you'll find several [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Each of these represents a project, in rising difficult. So project1 is the easiest, and where you should start. (And yes, if it's painfully easy, then you should do it, do it well, and do it quickly. Don't skip!)

Each project will have further instructions. Have fun, and ask us for help. We're here and available.
